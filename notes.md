# Truffula Notes
As part of Wave 0, please fill out notes for each of the below files. They are in the order I recommend you go through them. A few bullet points for each file is enough. You don't need to have a perfect understanding of everything, but you should work to gain an idea of how the project is structured and what you'll need to implement. Note that there are programming techniques used here that we have not covered in class! You will need to do some light research around things like enums and and `java.io.File`.

PLEASE MAKE FREQUENT COMMITS AS YOU FILL OUT THIS FILE.

## App.java

In the App.java, you will be able to choose from a variety of different options, such as whether to show hidden files, whether you will use your colored output that you will make in ColorPrinter (in wave 1), and it will help you choose the root directory that will be the starting point for the tree you will print.
